# Rukawa Analytics

**Live:** [rukawaanalytics.com](https://rukawaanalytics.com)

Portfolio of **Till Oscar Jacob ("Rukawa")**, a Clash Royale esports analyst focused on Solo CRL player preparation. The site presents the analysis method, publishes case studies, and shows live numbers from my analysis pipeline.

> Short version: I turn a player's battle log into set decisions — and I built the tooling that does it.

## What's in this repo

| Area | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Portfolio** (`/`) | Kinetic-typography hero with live pipeline numbers, scroll-driven walkthrough of the analysis system, approach, projects with real-data previews, experience, contact |
| **Case studies** (`/work`, `/work/:slug`) | Written as Markdown in `src/content/case-studies/`, rendered in the app |
| **Live stats** | Pulls aggregated, public numbers from my separate analysis pipeline (private repo) |
| **Contact** | Contact form (stored in Supabase) and optional call booking |
| **Strompreis-Kompass** (`/strompreis`) | German electricity price dashboard built on official Bundesnetzagentur data, see [docs](docs/strompreis-kompass/README.md) |
| **Race Strategy Lab** (`/race-strategy`) | Tyre strategy, tyre wear, race pace and pit stop analysis for every Grand Prix since 2023 (OpenF1 data), see [docs](docs/race-strategy-lab/README.md) |
| **Waza Arc** (`/arc/`, beta) | BJJ progress app as an anime-style RPG: 30-second training log, a daily quest you count on the mat, 178 techniques on a star-map skill tree, Ki rating and character sheet. Its own entry point with its own bundle and design; data stays in the browser for now. See [concept](docs/waza-arc/KONZEPT.md) |

Featured case study: [From Battle Log to Set Decision](src/content/case-studies/player-analysis-tooling.md) — how up to 1,000 recent battles per player become slot-based tendencies (Game 1/2/3) and remaining-deck predictions.

Data case study (German): [Wann Strom am günstigsten ist](src/content/case-studies/strompreis-kompass.md) — a year of German exchange electricity prices analysed in SQL; every number in it can be reproduced with [`docs/strompreis-kompass/analysis.sql`](docs/strompreis-kompass/analysis.sql).

- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Framer Motion, GSAP
- **Backend:** Supabase (Postgres, Row Level Security, Edge Functions), both projects hosted in the EU (Frankfurt)
- **Analysis pipeline:** separate private project — scheduled collection of battle logs, duel/set detection, deck hashing, meta aggregation, self-healing tracking
- **Database schema:** versioned in [`supabase/migrations`](supabase/migrations). The 2026 migrations (privacy retention job, Strompreis-Kompass, Race Strategy Lab) carry the same version numbers as in the live database; readable one-file versions are in [`docs/strompreis-kompass/schema.sql`](docs/strompreis-kompass/schema.sql) and [`docs/race-strategy-lab/schema.sql`](docs/race-strategy-lab/schema.sql).

## Security & privacy decisions

- The contact form is rate-limited.
- The key in `.env` is Supabase's **publishable (anon) key**, which is meant to be public; access control lives in RLS policies and the secure functions.
- Fonts and map data are bundled with the site instead of loaded from third-party CDNs; the Cal.com scheduler only loads after a visitor clicks "Book a call".

## How it was built

I designed the product, data model and analysis logic; the code was written AI-assisted using [Lovable](https://lovable.dev) and other AI tools. I operate and maintain the system myself. Changes made in Lovable are committed to this repo automatically.

### Run locally

Requires Node.js 18+.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/tojacob03/rukawa-clash-arena.git
cd rukawa-clash-arena
npm install
npm run dev
```

Checks — the same three run in CI ([`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml)) on every push:

```sh
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run build
```
